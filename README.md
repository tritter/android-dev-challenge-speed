## :scroll: Description
I implemented everything according to the EMEA-friendly timezone. This was the 'MySoothe' app.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
It was fun to implement, I hope I accomplished all tricky design parts.
I can finnaly relax now in MySoothe and get some nice ideas to relax after this challenge.


Some remarks:
• Black800 was not listed in colors but implemented as 80% black (#000000).
• First image-link was broken of 'Short mantras', used a replacement asset.
• The Buttons and fields are not usable.
